#things we need to know: starting subway, starting stop, ending subway, ending stop

#get above prompts from user and store as variables

#if starting subway == ending subway, calculate number of stops

#else, 1) count from starting stop to intersection of starting subway and ending subway
#      2) count from intersection of starting subway and ending subway to ending stop

#final output: "Your trip is X number of stops"
